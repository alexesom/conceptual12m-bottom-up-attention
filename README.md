# Analysing Conceptual 12m dataset using bottom-up-attention

## Project goal
Project with the main focus on analysing Conceptual 12m dataset images using bottom-up-attention and to counting similarity procentage for given labels from bottom-up-attention and labels from the dataset. The main goal of is to show how precise the **Faster R-CNN with ResNet-101** could find objects and there attributes in given dataset.

## How to run
